# bits

bits.lua is a strongly opinionated [Castle](https://www.castle.games) library intended for games of small character counts. For example, it may be used to make a gameâ€™s code fit within a tweet or two. (280 or 560 characters)

The documenation for the library is currently here in a Google Doc:

Sorry, will add markdown in GitHub later :)

We're all just little squares at heart.
